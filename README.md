# Tiny-TLS 1.3 Toy Implementation for COSI107a, Spring 2025, version 0.1

This document contains the implementation of a toy version of TLS 1.3, to be used as material for Brandeis' COSI107a course. The goal is to implement a minimalist version of TLS 1.3 that can communicate with a server using the protocol.

This is a work in progress, and it is expected that changes will be made to the protocol as we move forward
